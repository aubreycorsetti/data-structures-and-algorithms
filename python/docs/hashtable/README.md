# Hashtable
A hashtable is a table that refers to a key and a value

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:
set
get
has
keys
hash

### Approach & Efficiency
Used the code we did in class and worked off of that.

#### API

Set will hash the key and set the key and value pair.
get will return the value associated with that key
has determines if the key exists in the table
