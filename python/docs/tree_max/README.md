# Tree Max

#  Challenge

# Whiteboard

![tree whiteboard](tree.png)

# Approach and Efficiency

> First see if the tree is empty. If it's empty, return None If there are numbers, look through the tree and compare, finding what the highest value in the tree is.

# Solution

> pytest -k test_tree_max.py
