# Singly Linked List
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Created a Node class to create new nodes, created a LinkedList class to instansiate a new linked list, created insert method that adds a new node to the beginning of the list, created a strong method that returns all the values in the linked list as a string then I used while loops to itterate the the list for the includes and string methods.
