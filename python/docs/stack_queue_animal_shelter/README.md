# Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach. Implement the following methods: enqueue Arguments: animal animal can be either a dog or a cat object. dequeue Arguments: pref pref can be either "dog" or "cat" Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

# Approach & Efficiency
Create an animal shelter that has 2 attributes

• enqueue the input cat or dog
• then dequeue will have a result = None
• create loop that add elements to queue 2
• when queue is complete turn queue 2 into queue 1 and reset queue 2.

# Big O
Time O(n): is linear because of the loop used space O(n): cause it will grow when the commands are taking place

# API
The solution code is located in the code_challenges/stack_queue_animal_shelter.py file.

Within the virtual environment, install pytest via pip install pytest. From the Python folder, run tests via pytest tests/code_challenges/test_stack_queue_animal_shelter.py. All 5 tests passed.
